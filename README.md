# Highlights and benefits
- Reactive programming - Declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change.
- MVVM architecture - Better application of SOLID principles and encapsulation of components. Offering better testability and flexibility.

## Summary
This app currently shows all accounts and will eventually show the balance, overdraft, pending transactions.
Atm, it shows one demo account and transitions into a UITabViewController where you can switch between transactions and savings goals.

All network requests and errors are handled by the ViewModel through bindings.

You can create a new savings goal in the savings section.

Changes in the UI and UX will be made along with writing unit tests.

## Starling Bank's API
